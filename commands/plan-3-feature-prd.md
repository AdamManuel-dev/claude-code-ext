<methodology>
## Systematic PRD Development

<step n="1">Proposal Analysis</step>
<thinking>
The foundation PRD quality depends on thoroughly understanding the approved proposal's context, constraints, and strategic decisions.
</thinking>

Retrieval and extraction process:
- Load proposal using mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_get
- Extract core problem statement and user value
- Identify proposed solution approach
- Analyze technical strategy and constraints
- Review scope boundaries and exclusions

<step n="2">Technical Specification Framework</step>
Load comprehensive PRD template:
`/docs/command-resources/planning-templates/feature-prd.md`

<step n="3">Implementation-Focused Detailing</step>

<contemplation>
Each PRD section must serve the dual purpose of human understanding and AI implementation guidance. Technical specificity enables better code generation.
</contemplation>

### Title Refinement
<do_not_strip>
- Remove "Feature Proposal:" prefix for clarity
- Maintain descriptive, action-oriented naming
- Ensure consistency with system architecture
- Enable easy cross-reference in documentation
</do_not_strip>

### Strategic Overview
<thinking>
The overview bridges business context with technical implementation, ensuring developers understand both "what" and "why."
</thinking>
- Concise one-paragraph feature summary
- Reference original problem and user impact
- Connect to broader product strategy
- Establish success metrics

### Functional Requirements
<innermonologue>
Requirements must be specific enough for automated testing and clear enough for implementation validation.
</innermonologue>
- Convert scope into numbered, testable requirements
- Define specific user interactions and system responses
- Include comprehensive edge case handling
- Separate MVP functionality from future enhancements
- Establish measurable acceptance criteria

### UI/UX Specifications
<brainstorm>
Detailed user experience flows enable more accurate component design and interaction patterns.
</brainstorm>
- Step-by-step user interaction flows
- Identify specific components requiring modification
- Define keyboard shortcuts and accessibility features
- Specify responsive design considerations
- Detail error states and user feedback

### Technical Architecture
<methodology>
Map abstract requirements to concrete system components, enabling targeted implementation.
</methodology>
- Map requirements to specific files and components
- Detail necessary data model changes
- Specify API modifications and new endpoints
- Identify integration points and dependencies
- Define state management approach

### Implementation Guidance
<example>
LLM-optimized hints for efficient code generation and pattern reuse.
</example>
- Include AI-assistant implementation hints
- Reference existing architectural patterns
- Highlight potential technical gotchas
- Suggest optimal implementation sequencing
- Note performance and security considerations

### Quality Assurance Strategy
- Define unit test coverage requirements
- Specify integration test scenarios
- Create manual testing protocols
- Establish performance benchmarks

### Implementation Roadmap Preview
<implementation_plan>
Organize work by system areas to enable parallel development and clear dependency management.
</implementation_plan>
- Group tasks by architectural area (UI, Core, MCP, CLI, Documentation)
- Reference organizational structure for consistency
- Assess relative complexity per area
- Map inter-task dependencies
- Target 3-7 total tasks for manageable feature scope

## Step 4: Create or Update Task
If proposal was a task:
- Use mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_update to convert to PRD
- Update type to "prd" or "specification"
- Update title by removing "Feature Proposal:" prefix
- Update content with expanded PRD
- Maintain phase and area assignments
- Add relevant tags

If new:
- Use mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_create
- Link to original proposal if exists
- Assign to correct phase and primary area
- Add comprehensive tags
</prd_creation_process>

<contemplation>
## Solo Developer PRD Philosophy

PRDs for solo development require different optimization than enterprise documents. Focus on implementation clarity over process overhead.
</contemplation>

**Optimization Principles:**
<thinking>
Solo developers with AI assistance need PRDs that accelerate implementation rather than satisfy organizational requirements.
</thinking>
- Emphasize "what" and "how" over theoretical "why"
- Include concrete implementation hints for AI assistants
- Reference actual files, components, and architectural patterns
- Maintain actionable specificity over abstract requirements
- Optimize for LLM comprehension and code generation

**Avoid Enterprise Anti-Patterns:**
<do_not_strip>
- NO deployment strategies or rollout timelines
- NO artificial time estimates or deadline pressure
- NO platform-agnostic requirements unless truly critical
- NO over-engineered architectural solutions
- Keep testing strategies practical and focused
</do_not_strip>

**Draft Review Framework:**
<innermonologue>
Every PRD represents assumptions that need human validation before implementation begins.
</innermonologue>
- Flag all technical assumptions for verification
- Highlight decisions requiring strategic review
- Invite specific feedback on implementation approach
- Establish clear approval criteria for implementation start

<example>
## Proposal-to-PRD Transformation

**Source Proposal Summary:**
"Add Recently Modified filter showing tasks changed in last 24h"

**Resulting PRD Functional Requirements:**
```markdown
### Functional Requirements
1. Add "Recently Modified" option to task filter dropdown in TaskListView component
2. When selected, display only tasks where last_modified >= (now - 24 hours)
3. Sort results by last_modified descending (most recent first)
4. Show relative time in task list (e.g., "2 hours ago")
5. Include visual indicator for tasks modified in last hour
6. Maintain filter state in URL query params

### Technical Requirements
- Reuse existing FilterDropdown component
- Add last_modified field to Task type if not present
- Extend existing filter logic in useTaskFilter hook
- Use dayjs for time calculations (already in project)
```

- ✓ Technical specifications
- ✓ Implementation notes
- ✓ Task breakdown preview
- ✓ Human review section

Key assumptions to discuss:
- {List 2-3 major technical assumptions}
- {List any architectural decisions made}
- {Note any scope interpretations}

Please review the PRD and provide feedback on:
1. Technical approach appropriateness
2. Missing requirements or edge cases
3. Implementation complexity assessment
4. Any assumptions that need correction

Once reviewed and refined:
Create implementation tasks: `/project:04_feature-planning {ID}`
</output_format>

<mcp_usage>
Always use MCP tools:
- mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_get to load proposal
- mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_update to convert to PRD
- mcp__scopecraft-cmd__task_create if new PRD
- mcp__scopecraft-cmd__phase_list for current phase
- mcp__scopecraft-cmd__area_list to verify areas
</mcp_usage>
