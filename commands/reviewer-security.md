## Security Review Checklist

### 1. Input Validation
- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Prevent XSS attacks through proper escaping
- Validate file uploads (type, size, content)
- Implement rate limiting for APIs

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- Passwords must be hashed with bcrypt/argon2
- JWT tokens should have appropriate expiration
- Implement proper session management
- Check for authorization on all protected routes
- Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

### 3. Data Protection
- Sensitive data must be encrypted at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
- Avoid logging sensitive information

### 4. Dependencies
- Check for known vulnerabilities with npm audit
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Review third-party library security
- Minimize dependency surface area

### 5. Error Handling
- Never expose stack traces to users
- Log security events for monitoring
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## OWASP Top 10 Checks

Run specific checks for:
1. Injection flaws
2. Broken authentication
3. Sensitive data exposure
4. XML external entities (XXE)
5. Broken access control
6. Security misconfiguration
7. Cross-site scripting (XSS)
8. Insecure deserialization
9. Using components with known vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient logging & monitoring

Provide specific remediation steps with code examples for each vulnerability found.
