Read TODO.md and parse all items. Create implementation-log.md to track progress.

Initial setup:
1. Analyze TODO.md structure:
   - Identify priority markers (HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, CRITICAL)
   - Group related items by component/feature
   - Note any dependencies between tasks
   - Create a dependency graph if items reference each other

2. Create tracking system:
   - Copy TODO.md to TODO_BACKUP.md with timestamp
   - Set up implementation-log.md with columns: Task | Status | Files Changed | Tests Added | Notes
   - Create COMPLETED_TODOS.md for archiving finished items with implementation details

For each TODO item, following priority and dependency order:

1. Parse and understand:
   - Extract the full TODO text and any code context
   - Identify acceptance criteria (explicit or implied)
   - Determine scope (single file, multiple files, architectural change)
   - Check for related TODOs that should be done together

2. Research phase:
   - Search codebase for related code patterns
   - Check if similar functionality exists elsewhere
   - Look for existing tests that might need updating
   - Review any mentioned tickets/issues for additional context

3. Plan implementation:
   - Break down into subtasks if complex
   - Identify files that need modification
   - Determine what tests are needed
   - Consider edge cases and error handling
   - Check for breaking changes

4. Implement the change:
   - Create feature branch naming if applicable
   - Write the implementation following existing patterns
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Include helpful comments for non-obvious logic
   - Update any affected documentation

5. Testing approach:
   - Write unit tests for new functionality
   - Update existing tests if behavior changed
   - Add integration tests for cross-component changes
   - Test edge cases and error conditions
   - Run: yarn test <new-test-files> to verify

6. Verification:
   - Run related tests: yarn test --findRelatedTests <changed-files>
   - Type check: tsc --noEmit for affected files
   - Lint check: yarn lint <changed-files>
   - Manual testing if UI/UX changes involved

7. Update tracking:
   - Mark item as DONE in TODO.md with date and PR/commit reference
   - Move completed item to COMPLETED_TODOS.md with:
     * Original TODO text
     * Implementation summary
     * Files changed
     * Tests added
     * Any follow-up tasks created
   - Update implementation-log.md

Special handling:

For vague TODOs (e.g., "optimize this", "refactor later"):
- Analyze what specifically needs improvement
- Create concrete subtasks in TODO.md
- If unclear, add to NEEDS_CLARIFICATION.md

For deprecated/invalid TODOs:
- Move to OBSOLETE_TODOS.md with explanation
- Note why it's no longer needed

For partially completable TODOs:
- Implement what's possible
- Update TODO with remaining work
- Add blocker information if applicable

For TODOs requiring significant refactoring:
- Create REFACTORING_PLAN.md
- Break into incremental steps
- Implement incrementally with tests

Quality checks after each implementation:
1. No regression: yarn test
2. Type safety: tsc --noEmit
3. Code style: yarn lint
4. Bundle size impact (if applicable)
5. Performance impact for critical paths

Progress monitoring:
- After every 5 TODOs, run full test suite
- Generate coverage report to ensure no decrease
- Check for new TODOs accidentally introduced
- Review implementation-log.md for patterns

When blocked:
- Document blocker in BLOCKED_TODOS.md
- Include what's needed to unblock
- Create new TODO for unblocking task
- Move to next prioritized item

Final summary:
- Count of TODOs completed vs remaining
- Major features/improvements implemented
- Technical debt reduced
- New TODOs discovered during implementation
- Recommendations for future work
- Time estimates vs actual for future planning

Remember:
- Each TODO completion should leave code better than found
- Don't just remove TODOs - implement them properly
- If a TODO reveals a bigger issue, document it
- Maintain backward compatibility unless explicitly noted
