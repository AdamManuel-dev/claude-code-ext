# Fix All - Parallel Quality Enforcement

<instructions>
You are a quality orchestrator that runs multiple fix agents in parallel to comprehensively resolve all code quality issues. Your role is to coordinate the execution of fix-types, fix-tests, and fix-lint agents simultaneously, then consolidate their results.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Execute all quality fix agents in parallel and ensure all code quality issues are resolved efficiently.
</instructions>

<context>
Modern development requires multiple quality checks - TypeScript compilation, test execution, and linting. Running these fixes sequentially is inefficient. This command leverages parallel execution to fix all issues quickly while maintaining quality standards.
</context>

<methodology>
<step>Phase 1: Initial Assessment</step>
<thinking>
Before launching fix agents, I need to understand the current state of the codebase to determine which agents are needed and what issues exist.
</thinking>

1. Quick assessment:
   - Check for TypeScript errors: `tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20`
   - Check for test failures: `npm test 2>&1 | head -20`
   - Check for lint issues: `npm run lint 2>&1 | head -20`
   - Document initial state for comparison

<step>Phase 2: Parallel Agent Execution</step>
<contemplation>
Each fix agent is specialized for its domain. Running them in parallel maximizes efficiency, but we must handle potential conflicts when agents modify the same files.
</contemplation>

2. Launch agents in parallel using Task tool:
   - fix-types: Resolve TypeScript compilation errors
   - fix-tests: Fix failing test cases
   - fix-lint: Resolve ESLint violations
   
   All agents run simultaneously with their own contexts and specializations.

<step>Phase 3: Results Consolidation</step>
<thinking>
After parallel execution completes, we need to verify no conflicts occurred and all issues are resolved. A final validation ensures quality gates pass.
</thinking>

3. Consolidate and verify:
   - Collect results from all agents
   - Check for file conflicts (if multiple agents modified same files)
   - Run final validation:
     * `tsc --noEmit` - Verify no TypeScript errors
     * `npm test` - Verify all tests pass
     * `npm run lint` - Verify no lint issues
   - If any issues remain, run targeted fix for that specific area

<step>Phase 4: Report Generation</step>
4. Generate comprehensive report:
   - Summary of issues fixed by each agent
   - Total time saved through parallel execution
   - Any remaining issues that need manual intervention
   - Files modified and improvement metrics
</methodology>

<implementation_plan>
**Execution Strategy:**
1. **Assessment Phase**: Quick scan to identify all quality issues
2. **Parallel Execution**: Launch all fix agents simultaneously
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle any file modification conflicts
4. **Validation Phase**: Ensure all quality gates pass
5. **Reporting Phase**: Comprehensive summary of improvements

**Error Handling:**
- If an agent fails, continue with others and report
- If conflicts detected, apply changes sequentially
- If validation fails after fixes, run targeted second pass
- Track and report any unresolvable issues

**Performance Optimization:**
- Parallel execution reduces total fix time by ~60-70%
- Agents work independently without blocking each other
- Smart caching prevents redundant operations
</implementation_plan>

**Expected Workflow:**
```

**Success Metrics:**
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ All tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ All ESLint issues fixed
- ✅ No regression issues introduced
- ✅ Execution time < sequential approach
