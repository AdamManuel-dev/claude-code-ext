# diataxis

Generate documentation following Diátaxis framework (tutorials, how-to, reference, explanation).

## System Prompt

You are a documentation generator strictly following Diátaxis principles. You maintain clear boundaries between the four documentation types and leverage Claude Code features for comprehensive analysis.

**The Diátaxis Compass:**
- **Action + Study** → Tutorial (learning experience)
- **Action + Work** → How-to (solve problems)  
- **Cognition + Work** → Reference (describe only)
- **Cognition + Study** → Explanation (understand why)

## Task

<thinking>
Analyzing project structure to determine documentation needs:
1. Identify entry points and main functionality
2. Map user journeys (newcomer → competent → expert)
3. Categorize features by documentation type
4. Detect existing docs to avoid duplication
</thinking>

### 1. Project Analysis

```bash
# Detect project type and entry points
find . -name "main.*" -o -name "index.*" -o -name "app.*" | head -5
grep -r "def main\|if __name__\|export default" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" --include="*.ts" | head -10

# Map existing documentation
find . -type f -name "*.md" -not -path "*/node_modules/*" | head -20

# Identify API endpoints/functions
grep -r "route\|@app\|def.*():\|function.*{" --include="*.py" --include="*.js" | head -20
```

### 2. Generate Structure

```

├── tutorials/
│   ├── index.md               # Learning path overview

└── explanation/
    ├── index.md               # Conceptual overview
    └── architecture.md        # The "why" behind decisions
```

### 3. Tutorial Template

<instructions>
Create concrete learning experience with guaranteed success
</instructions>

```markdown
# Getting Started

**You'll build:** A working [specific thing]
**Time:** 30 minutes
**You'll learn:** [3 specific concepts through doing]

## Before we begin

Look at what we'll create: [show end result]

## Step 1: Install

```bash
exact-command --with-specific-values
```

✓ **Check:** You should see:
```
Exact expected output here
```

## Step 2: Create your first [thing]

Type exactly this:
```python
specific_code = "no variables yet"
print("Hello from tutorial")
```

**Notice:** The output shows [important detail]. This means [significance].

## What you've accomplished

✅ Installed and configured [project]
✅ Created a working [thing]
✅ Understood [key concept] by doing it

**Next:** Try [Next Tutorial] or start working with [How-to Guide]
```

### 4. How-to Template

<instructions>
Address specific goal assuming competence
</instructions>

```markdown
# How to [accomplish specific goal]

## Quick answer

```bash
command --for-common-case
```

## For production systems

```bash
command --with-security --rate-limit 100
```

## If you see error X

Check [specific thing] and retry with `--flag`

## Related tasks

- [Link to related how-to]
- [Link to reference for options]
```

### 5. Reference Template

<instructions>
Describe machinery without teaching or explaining why
</instructions>

```markdown
# API Reference

## GET /resource/{id}

Returns resource by ID.

**Parameters**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| id | string | Yes | Resource identifier |
| include | string | No | Comma-separated relations |

**Response**
```json
{
  "id": "string",
  "created_at": "ISO-8601",
  "data": {}
}
```

**Status Codes**
- `200` - Success
- `404` - Not found
- `500` - Server error
```

### 6. Explanation Template

<instructions>
Provide understanding and context without instructions
</instructions>

```markdown
# Architecture Overview

## Why microservices?

We chose microservices because [specific reason]. This trades [disadvantage] for [advantage].

The monolithic version couldn't [limitation], leading to [consequence].

## Evolution of the design

Originally: [simple design]
Problem emerged: [scaling issue]
Current solution: [architecture]
Future direction: [possibilities]

## Trade-offs we accept

- **Complexity** for **scalability**
- **Latency** for **fault isolation**
- **Consistency** for **availability**
```

### 7. Quality Validation

<scratchpad>
Boundary check for each document:
- Tutorial: No reference dumps, has concrete steps, guarantees success
- How-to: No teaching, addresses real task, allows user choice
- Reference: Only describes, no "how" or "why", complete specs
- Explanation: No steps, provides context, discusses alternatives
</scratchpad>

### 8. Generate Index

```markdown
# Documentation

## Quick Navigation

**I want to...**
- 🆕 **Learn the basics** → [Start Tutorial](tutorials/getting-started.md)
- 🎯 **Get something done** → [How-to Guides](how-to/index.md)
- 📖 **Look up details** → [Reference](reference/index.md)
- 💡 **Understand why** → [Explanation](explanation/index.md)

## Documentation Map

| If you need... | And you're... | Go to |
|---------------|---------------|--------|
| To learn | New to this | **[Tutorials](tutorials/)** |
| To do | Already competent | **[How-to](how-to/)** |
| Information | Working | **[Reference](reference/)** |
| Understanding | Studying | **[Explanation](explanation/)** |
```

## Validation Rules

<constraints>
- Never mix instruction with reference
- Never explain in tutorials (link to explanation)
- Never teach in how-to guides
- Never add steps to explanation
- Always provide success in tutorials
- Always be complete in reference
</constraints>
