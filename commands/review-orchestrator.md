- Quality: TypeScript best practices, logic correctness, architecture
- Security: Vulnerability detection, authentication, data protection
- Design: UI/UX quality, accessibility, visual consistency
- Testing: Test effectiveness, coverage analysis, quality validation
- E2E: Integration testing, user flows, end-to-end validation

EXECUTION MODEL:
- Stage-based progressive validation with early exit on failures
- Parallel reviewer execution within stages for maximum efficiency
- Real-time progress tracking and consolidated findings view
- Automatic git command execution upon successful completion
</context>

<contemplation>
The orchestrator faces several strategic challenges:

1. **Efficiency vs Thoroughness**: Balance comprehensive analysis with execution speed
2. **Parallel Coordination**: Manage multiple reviewers without conflicts or redundancy
3. **Progressive Validation**: Align review stages with natural development workflow
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Keep users informed without overwhelming them
5. **Error Recovery**: Handle failures gracefully with actionable guidance

The system should intelligently prioritize issues, consolidate findings from multiple reviewers, and provide a unified experience that feels like a single, highly capable reviewer rather than a collection of separate tools.

Key design principles:
- Fail fast on critical issues to save time and resources
- Consolidate overlapping findings from multiple reviewers
- Provide actionable, prioritized feedback with clear next steps
- Maintain audit trail for debugging and improvement
</contemplation>

- **add** - Run Stage 1 only (basic validation before staging)
- **commit** - Run Stages 1-2 (basic + core quality before committing)
- **push** - Run Stages 1-3 (basic + core + advanced before pushing)
- **merge** - Run all Stages 1-4 (full review before merging to main)

## Description

<methodology>
ORCHESTRATION METHODOLOGY:
1. Initialize unified dashboard with real-time progress tracking
2. Parse command to determine required validation stages
3. Execute stages sequentially with parallel reviewers within each stage
4. Consolidate findings from all reviewers with overlap detection
5. Apply automatic fixes with validation and rollback capability
6. Generate comprehensive reports and execute git commands
7. Provide user notifications and maintain audit trail

REVIEWER COORDINATION STRATEGY:
- Execute reviewers in parallel within stages for efficiency
- Cross-correlate findings to identify overlapping issues
- Prioritize fixes based on severity and reviewer consensus
- Validate fixes don't introduce new issues or conflicts
- Maintain real-time progress updates across all reviewers

PROGRESSIVE VALIDATION APPROACH:
- Stage 1 (add): Critical error prevention only
- Stage 2 (commit): Core quality assurance (readability, quality, security)
- Stage 3 (push): Advanced validation (design, testing)
- Stage 4 (merge): Complete integration validation (E2E, documentation)
</methodology>

Orchestrates all review specialists in parallel batches:

<batch>
<item>üü° Basic Review: Anti-patterns, common mistakes, critical errors</item>
<item>üü¢ Readability Review: Naming conventions, structure, documentation</item>
<item>üîµ Quality Review: TypeScript best practices, logic correctness, architecture</item>
<item>üî¥ Security Review: Vulnerability detection, authentication, data protection</item>
<item>üü£ Design Review: UI/UX quality, accessibility, visual consistency</item>
<item>üß™ Testing Review: Test effectiveness, coverage, quality validation</item>
<item>üîµ E2E Review: Integration testing, user flows, end-to-end validation</item>
</batch>

Each reviewer automatically applies fixes and validates changes with rollback capability.

## Execution Workflow

<contemplation>
The workflow design must balance comprehensive validation with developer productivity. Different git commands represent different quality gates in the development process, each requiring appropriate levels of validation.

The stage-based approach allows developers to get quick feedback for basic operations (add) while ensuring thorough validation for critical operations (merge to main).
</contemplation>

The orchestrator executes different validation stages based on your intended git command, aligning with natural development workflow patterns:

### Stage 1: Pre-Add Validation (`add`)

<investigation>
BASIC VALIDATION FOCUS AREAS:
- Syntax errors and compilation failures
- Console.log statements in production code
- Hardcoded secrets or sensitive data
- ESLint errors and TypeScript issues
- Unused imports and dead code
- Test failures in affected areas

AUTOMATIC FIX CAPABILITIES:
- Remove console.log statements automatically
- Clean up unused imports and variables
- Fix basic TypeScript type errors
- Add TODO comments for eslint-disable usage
- Format code according to project standards
</investigation>

- üü° **Basic Review**: Anti-patterns, common mistakes, critical errors
- **When to use**: Before `git add` - catch obvious issues before staging
- **Exit action**: `git add .` (if no critical issues)

### Stage 2: Pre-Commit Quality (`commit`)

<batch>
<item>Stage 1: Basic validation foundation</item>
<item>Readability Review: Naming, structure, documentation (parallel)</item>
<item>Quality Review: TypeScript, logic, patterns (parallel)</item>
<item>Security Review: Vulnerabilities, auth, data protection (parallel)</item>
</batch>

- üü° **Stage 1**: Basic validation
- üü¢ **Readability Review**: Naming, structure, documentation
- üîµ **Quality Review**: TypeScript, logic, patterns  
- üî¥ **Security Review**: Vulnerabilities, auth, data protection
- **When to use**: Before `git commit` - ensure code quality before committing
- **Exit action**: `git commit -m "feat: [generated message]"` (if stages 1-2 pass)

### Stage 3: Pre-Push Validation (`push`)

<batch>
<item>Stages 1-2: Basic and Core Quality validation</item>
<item>Design Review: UI/UX, accessibility, visual consistency (parallel)</item>
<item>Testing Review: Test effectiveness, coverage, mocking (parallel)</item>
</batch>

- üü°üü¢üîµüî¥ **Stages 1-2**: Basic + Core Quality
- üü£ **Design Review**: UI/UX, accessibility, visual consistency
- üß™ **Testing Review**: Test effectiveness, coverage, mocking
- **When to use**: Before `git push` - comprehensive validation before sharing
- **Exit action**: `git push origin [branch]` (if stages 1-3 pass)

### Stage 4: Pre-Merge Review (`merge`)

<investigation>
MERGE READINESS ANALYSIS:
- Complete end-to-end user flow validation
- API endpoint integration testing with real data
- Cross-component interaction verification
- Performance impact assessment and optimization
- Documentation completeness and accuracy check
- Breaking change identification and documentation
- Backward compatibility verification
- Security vulnerability scan and remediation

FINAL QUALITY GATES:
- All automated tests passing
- No critical security vulnerabilities
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation updated
- Breaking changes documented
- Migration scripts provided (if needed)
- Team review approval recorded
</investigation>

- üü°üü¢üîµüî¥üü£üß™ **All Previous Stages**: Complete validation
- üîµ **E2E Review**: Integration testing, user flows, end-to-end validation
- üìù **Final Documentation**: Ensure all changes are documented
- üîç **Merge Readiness**: Verify branch is ready for main integration
- **When to use**: Before merging to main - full quality gate
- **Exit action**: Notify user to proceed with merge (manual approval required)

## Failure Criteria for Early Exit

<methodology>
EARLY EXIT DECISION MATRIX:

Critical Failures (Immediate Exit):
- Compilation/syntax errors blocking basic functionality
- Hardcoded secrets or API keys exposed
- Critical security vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0+)
- Test failures in main business logic
- Missing essential dependencies

High Priority Issues (Exit with Warning):
- Major security vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0+)
- Logic errors in critical business paths
- Type safety issues causing runtime errors
- Performance issues causing timeouts
- Accessibility violations (WCAG AA failures)

Informational Issues (Continue with Fixes):
- Code style violations
- Minor naming inconsistencies
- Non-critical documentation gaps
- Low-impact performance optimizations

RESOURCE OPTIMIZATION:
- Stop expensive analysis when basics fail
- Cache validation results between stages
- Prioritize fixes with highest impact/effort ratio
- Skip redundant checks when issues are already fixed
</methodology>

### Stage 1 (Basic) - Critical Failures:

- Compilation/syntax errors
- Hardcoded secrets or API keys
- Failing tests in main branch
- Missing essential dependencies
- Security vulnerabilities (Critical/High)

### Stage 2 (Core Quality) - Critical Failures:

- Major security vulnerabilities
- Logic errors in critical business paths  
- Type safety issues causing runtime errors
- Accessibility violations (WCAG AA)
- Performance issues causing timeouts

### Early Exit Benefits:

- **Time Saving**: Avoid complex analysis when basics fail
- **Resource Efficiency**: Don't waste compute on unfixable code
- **Developer Focus**: Address critical issues first
- **Faster Feedback**: Get essential fixes immediately

## Implementation of Unified Dashboard

<thinking>
The unified dashboard is crucial for user experience. It needs to provide clear, actionable information without overwhelming the user. The real-time updates should be meaningful and help users understand both progress and priorities.

Key considerations:
- Update frequency should be balanced (not too spammy, not too slow)
- Cross-reviewer correlations help avoid duplicate work
- Priority-based presentation helps users focus on what matters
- Audit trail supports debugging and learning
</thinking>

### Real-Time Update Mechanism

The orchestrator maintains a shared state that aggregates findings from all active reviewers:

<example>
```typescript
interface UnifiedDashboard {
  stages: {
    current: number;
    total: number;
    status: 'running' | 'complete' | 'failed';
  };
  reviewers: {
    [key: string]: {
      status: 'waiting' | 'running' | 'complete' | 'failed';
      issuesFound: number;
      issuesFixed: number;
      criticalIssues: Issue[];
      progress: number;
    };
  };
  consolidatedFindings: {
    critical: Issue[];
    high: Issue[];
    medium: Issue[];
    low: Issue[];
  };
  filesModified: string[];
  metricsTimeline: MetricPoint[];
}
```
</example>

### Cross-Reviewer Issue Correlation

<investigation>
CORRELATION ANALYSIS:
Issues found by multiple reviewers are automatically merged and prioritized based on:

1. **Severity Consensus**: Multiple reviewers flagging same issue increases priority
2. **Context Overlap**: Same file/function flagged by different perspectives
3. **Fix Complexity**: Consolidated fixes are often more efficient than separate fixes
4. **Impact Assessment**: Cross-reviewer validation of fix necessity

CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY:
- Merge duplicate issues from different reviewers
- Combine related fixes to avoid conflicts
- Prioritize based on reviewer consensus
- Track fix dependencies and ordering
</investigation>

Issues found by multiple reviewers are automatically merged and prioritized:

<example>
```
üîó CROSS-REVIEWER CORRELATIONS
‚îú‚îÄ auth.ts:23 - Found by Security (hardcoded secret) + Basic (magic string)
‚îú‚îÄ Button.tsx:45 - Found by Design (poor contrast) + Readability (unclear name)  
‚îî‚îÄ api.ts:12 - Found by Security (no validation) + Quality (missing types)
```
</example>

### Live Update Frequency

- **Stage transitions**: Immediate update
- **Issue discovery**: Real-time as found
- **Fix application**: Update per fix applied
- **Progress metrics**: Every 5 seconds
- **File modifications**: Immediate on change

### Dashboard Refresh Strategy

## Stage 4: Automatic Finalization

<step>Collect all applied fixes and generate comprehensive commit message</step>
<step>Execute git add command to stage all modified files</step>
<step>Create conventional commit with detailed fix summary</step>
<step>Push changes to remote repository if requested</step>

After all reviews complete successfully, the orchestrator automatically:

### 1. Commit Changes

<example>
```bash
# Generate conventional commit message based on applied fixes
git add .
git commit -m "feat(review): automated code improvements

- Fixed 27 issues across 7 review domains
- Applied TypeScript fixes (7 issues)
- Resolved security vulnerabilities (3 critical)
- Improved test coverage from 67% to 84%
- Enhanced code readability (15 naming issues)
- Added accessibility improvements (5 UI issues)
- Applied basic anti-pattern fixes (15 issues)

Co-authored-by: Review-Orchestrator <review-orchestrator@ai>"
```
</example>

### 2. Push to Remote

```bash
# Push the improved code to remote repository
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
```

### 3. User Notification

```bash
# Alert user that review cycle is complete
BRANCH_NAME=$(git branch --show-current)
osascript -e "display notification \"üì¢ [$BRANCH_NAME]\" with title \"üéØ Review Orchestrator Complete! 27 issues fixed across 8 files\" sound name \"Submarine\""
```

## Git Command Integration

<methodology>
AUTOMATED GIT EXECUTION STRATEGY:
1. Validate all required stages have passed successfully
2. Generate appropriate conventional commit messages
3. Execute git commands in proper sequence (add ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push)
4. Provide user notifications at each step
5. Handle failures gracefully with rollback capability

COMMIT MESSAGE GENERATION:
- Use conventional commit format (feat, fix, refactor, etc.)
- Summarize fixes by category and impact
- Include metrics (issues fixed, files modified, coverage improved)
- Add co-author attribution to Review Orchestrator
- Reference specific improvements made by each reviewer
</methodology>

### Automatic Execution

When stages pass, the orchestrator automatically runs the appropriate git command:

<example>
```bash
# Stage 1 (add) - Basic validation passed
git add .
osascript -e "display notification \"üì¢ Files Staged\" with title \"‚úÖ Basic validation passed - files added to staging\" sound name \"Submarine\""

# Stage 2 (commit) - Quality checks passed  
git commit -m "feat: automated code improvements

- Fixed 15 basic issues (console.logs, unused imports)
- Improved code readability (8 naming violations)
- Applied TypeScript fixes (4 type errors)
- Resolved security issues (2 vulnerabilities)

Co-authored-by: Review-Orchestrator <review-orchestrator@ai>"
osascript -e "display notification \"üì¢ Committed\" with title \"‚úÖ Code quality validated - changes committed\" sound name \"Submarine\""

# Stage 3 (push) - Full validation passed
git push origin $(git branch --show-current)
osascript -e "display notification \"üì¢ Pushed\" with title \"‚úÖ Full validation passed - code pushed to remote\" sound name \"Submarine\""

# Stage 4 (merge) - Complete review passed
echo "üéØ Code is ready for merge to main branch"
echo "üìã All quality gates passed - manual merge approval recommended"
osascript -e "display notification \"üì¢ Ready for Merge\" with title \"‚úÖ Complete review passed - ready for main branch\" sound name \"Submarine\""
```
</example>

## Examples

### Slash Command Examples

<example>
```bash
/review-orchestrator add                    # Stage 1 only - basic validation before git add
/review-orchestrator commit                 # Stages 1-2 - quality check before git commit
/review-orchestrator push                   # Stages 1-3 - full validation before git push
/review-orchestrator merge                  # All stages - complete review before merge
/review-orchestrator src/ commit            # Review src/ directory before committing
/review-orchestrator                       # All stages (default)
```
</example>

### Global Command Examples

<example>
```bash
# Development workflow
review-orchestrator add                     # Before staging files
review-orchestrator commit                  # Before committing changes
review-orchestrator push                    # Before pushing to remote
review-orchestrator merge                   # Before merging to main

# With specific directories
review-orchestrator src/ commit             # Review src/ before commit
review-orchestrator . push                  # Review current dir before push

# Using aliases (after installation)
ro add                                     # Quick basic validation (alias)
review-orchestrator commit                 # Quality check before commit
```
</example>
